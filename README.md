## Computer Networks Socket Projects
In this project we made a Peer-to-Peer in terminal Six Card Golf Game. You have two main files: tracker.py that tracks players and games information, and player.py that represents end players. The player who initiates a game is considered the dealer and will request players information from the tracker. Once the information of the other players is obtained, the game can will run as P2P.
 ## How to play
 To start a game first run tracker.py and give it the needed information, then you need to run multiple player.py programs to register players and start a game.
